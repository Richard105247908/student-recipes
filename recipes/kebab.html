    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>    
    <p> This doner kebab is so tasty â€” I'm sure once you try it, you'll want to make more! Serve with lightly toasted pitta or flatbread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. It's easy to make in advance, slice and freeze for whenever you get that craving!.</p>
