# student-recipes
Brief Introduction(about project and skills demonstrated)
THis is a project where my recently learned HTML skills are being used in action.
 I made use <a href> to link several other pages together
 i made use of <img src> to inset images to give a physical represeantion of what
 the recipes should look like
 I made use of <p>, <h1> to organise and highlight my writing and I used <ul>/<ol>
 to further organise the ingredients and steps needed.
